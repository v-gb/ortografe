(** A module that implements approximate dictionary search.

    Specifically, given a request "nec" :
    - it returns words that starts with that request, like "nectar", including with
      diacritics like "nÃ©cessaire"
    - if the query contains diacritics, then completions will only contain words that
      respect such diacritics
    - it returns the shortest completions first
    - it doesn't return duplicate entries if the both words match
    - Å“ is treated as oe
    - it's quick (20us to 400us kind of numbers) *)

type 'a t [@@deriving bin_io]

val create : (('a -> string -> unit) -> unit) -> 'a t

val search :
     'a t
  -> ?sexp_of:('a -> Sexplib0.Sexp.t)
  -> compare:('a -> 'a -> int)
  -> limit:int
  -> string
  -> (string * 'a) list

module Erofa : sig
  type index = int
  (** When >= 0, an index in the array below. When < 0, it indicates an unchanged entry
      (which is omitted from the array). When < 0, the two lower bits encode information
      other than the identity of the entry:
      - 1 lsl 0 indicates whether the entry also includes a plural in s
      - 1 lsl 1 indictates whether the matched word is the singular or the plural (only
        meaningful when bit zero is also set) *)

  type nonrec t = (string list * string * string * int) array * index t

  val to_persist : t -> string
  val of_persist : string -> t

  type flags = { implied_plural : bool }

  val search : t -> string -> limit:int -> (string list * string * string * flags) list
